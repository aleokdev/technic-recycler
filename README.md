# technic-recycler
WIP Addon for minetest's technic mod that adds the possibility to recycle useless items to more useful ones.

# How it works
This addon adds the "High Voltage Advanced Centrifuge" to the game, amongst other things, that helps to make cobblestone recyclable. When cobblestone and power is added to the machine, it gives you a small quantity of various useful ores, those being iron, copper, gold and aluminium, being the last used for other advanced recipes (In LagWorld, aluminium could be used in the future for making travelnets and digtrons) or just for making aluminium casings, which are durable and resistant.
